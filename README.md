# descentralize-user-profile
A fully decentralized User profile app on Ethereum and IPFS

This is a distributed application on Ethereum and IPFS. The app enables users to sign up with a username, a title, and a short intro. It stores some of these fields on the Ethereum blockchain, and some off-chain on IPFS. It also lets everyone browse through the existing user profiles.
